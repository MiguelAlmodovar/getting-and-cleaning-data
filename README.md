## The script

- 1. All the data tables for test and train are read and bond together.
- 2. Creates a dataset with all the observations (on the mean and standard deviation).
- 3. Appropriately labels the columns and activities
- 4. Creates a tidy dataset with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
